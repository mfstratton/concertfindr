# Privacy Policy for ConcertFindr™

**Last Updated:** May 10, 2025

Thank you for using ConcertFindr™ ("App", "Service", "we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of our App.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Information We Collect**

ConcertFindr™ is designed to be simple and focused. We do **not** directly collect or store any personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, or precise location.

The information you provide within the app is used as follows:

* **City/Location Search Term:** The city or location name you type is sent to the Mapbox Search Box API to provide autocomplete suggestions and to retrieve geographic coordinates for that location.
* **Selected Dates:** The start and end dates you select are used to query the Ticketmaster Discovery API for relevant concert listings.

**Third-Party Services**

ConcertFindr™ uses the following third-party services to provide its functionality. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them:

* **Mapbox:** We use the Mapbox Search Box API to provide city autocomplete suggestions and to convert selected city names into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for concert searches.
    * Mapbox Privacy Policy: [https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy)
* **Ticketmaster:** We use the Ticketmaster Discovery API to fetch concert listings based on the geographic coordinates and date range you provide.
    * Ticketmaster Privacy Policy: [https://www.ticketmaster.com/h/privacy.html](https://www.ticketmaster.com/h/privacy.html) (or search for "Ticketmaster API Privacy Policy" if this link changes)

These third-party services may collect data such as your IP address, device information, and search queries as part of their operations. We do not control how these third parties collect or use your information.

**API Keys**

The App uses API keys to communicate with Mapbox and Ticketmaster services. These keys are embedded within the application build but are configured with restrictions (where possible and applicable for mobile applications) to limit their use to the intended functionality of ConcertFindr™.

**Log Data**

Like many app developers, we may use third-party services (such as Google Play Console analytics or a future error reporting service) that collect information your device sends whenever you use our App ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized and is used to help us improve the app.

**Cookies**

Our mobile application does not use "cookies" explicitly. However, third-party code and libraries used in the app may use "cookies" or similar technologies to collect information and improve their services.

**Children's Privacy**

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
